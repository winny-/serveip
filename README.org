* serveip

  Simple HTTP microservice to respond with the client's IP.

** Caveats

   - [[https://github.com/docker/for-linux/issues/182][It does not work in Docker]]. One gets back the Docker bridge's address.

** Usage

   #+BEGIN_SRC sh
   raco pkg install --link --auto  # Install from git.

   serveip --log-file requests.log :: 8080 # Log to `requests.log' and listen on all addresses on port 8080.
   racket -l serveip -m -- --log-file requests.log :: 8080 # Same if your user racket binaries path is not in PATH.

   curl localhost:8080 # Get your IP address.
   #+END_SRC
